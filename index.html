        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
          I recently offered my Javascript expertise to help George Hart restore his
          <a href="https://georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/vp.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Virtual Polyhedra</a> pages,
          which have around 1200 VRML models meant to be interactively viewed in 3D.
          That has been effectively impossible for about twenty years; you can learn why in the
          history section below.
        </p>

        <p>
          When George and I shared the results, a number of authors of other polyhedra sites spoke up,
          since they were all in similar circumstances.
          I've started working with those that contacted me, and my progress is captured in the table below.
          In all cases I'm volunteering my efforts to revive the VRML models on their pages, either as a friend or just as a community member
          vested in the value of these amazing sites.
        </p>

        <p>
          For all of the entries in the table that say "POC" or "archive", I have scraped only a handful of pages,
          so you will find many broken links; don't bother trying to navigate among those pages.
          In addition, I haven't scraped all the VRML files mentioned, only those that have thumbnail images,
          so you'll find VRML highlights in the text that won't work.
        </p>

        <p>
          There is a lot more to say here about the technology, and about related efforts.  Stay tuned!  This page is very much
          a work-in-progress.

        <h2>History</h2>

        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VRML" target="_blank">VRML</a>
          was developed in the early 1990s, with a grandiose vision of being the "language of virtual reality".
          Unfortunately, the vision was ahead of its time; computing hardware of the time was not really
          sufficient to the demands of 3D graphics as envisioned by VRML.
          Nonetheless, VRML extensions for web browsers were developed, and saw some adoption.
        </p>

        <p>
          One community that embraced VRML was polyhedron enthusiasts.
          As abstract geometrical objects, many polyhedra existed mainly as drawings in books,
          only occasionally constructed as physical models.
          They were, and remain, a perfect candidate for computer graphics.
          The polyhedra enthusiasts listed on this page were therefore drawn to the web, and to VRML.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the ensuing years, the landscape of 3D graphics changed, particularly in the web.
          OpenGL became a standard in 2006, and WebGL in 2011.
          GPUs became common in personal computers in the early 2000s,
          and in mobile phones much more recently.
          The original VRML browser extensions were not maintained in the face of all
          these changes.
        </p>

        <p>
          VRML survives now as
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X3D">X3D</a>, essentially an XML representation of the same ideas.
          It may yet succeed in becoming a native web standard, embeddable in HTML alongside
          MathML and SVG.
